# VR Device Mock Branch

This branch is used to simulate the VR headset and controllers using `keyboard` and `mouse`.

> Before using this branch, you need to download the `HMD Mock Loader` package and XR Interaction Toolkit's `XR Device Simulator` asset.
Following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlqdHrfXppo&ab_channel=Valem) should be enough.

How to use this branch:
- Create a branch from this one
- Merge the changes from the branch you want to test
- Test!

> Note: Keyboard and mouse controls can be seen and edited by opening the `XR Device Simulator` input actions object located in: `Assets/Samples/XR Interaction Toolkit/2.2.0/XR Device Simulator`

> Note 2: Merging this branch with your development branch is not recommended, as the `HMD Mock Loader` package is in an `experimental stage`.
